/**
 * Admin Animation Components
 * 
 * These components provide smooth, professional animations
 * that are more refined than the staff version
 * 
 * Usage:
 * - PageTransition: Wrap entire page content
 * - FadeIn: Individual elements that need fade-in
 * - StaggerContainer + StaggerItem: Lists that animate in sequence
 * - ScaleIn: Cards, modals, stats that need pop-in effect
 * - BuildUp: Assembly/build-up effect for sections (lắp ghép)
